## 🏗️ Training Framework

Our training pipeline leverages **PyTorch** and optimized **CUDA extensions** to efficiently produce high-quality trained models in record time.

### 💻 Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- **Memory**: 24 GB VRAM (for paper-quality results; we recommend NVIDIA RTX4090)

### 📦 Software Requirements

- **Conda** (recommended for streamlined setup)
- **C++ Compiler** compatible with PyTorch extensions
- **CUDA SDK 11** (or compatible version)
- **⚠️ Important**: Ensure C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK versions are compatible

### ⚠️ CUDA Version Reference

Our testing environment uses the following CUDA configuration:

| Component                             | Version          |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Conda environment CUDA version        | 11.6             |
| Ubuntu system `nvidia-smi` CUDA       | 12.2             |
| `nvcc -V` compiler version            | 11.8 (v11.8.89)  |

> **Note**: The Conda CUDA and system CUDA versions may differ. The compiler version (`nvcc`) is what matters for PyTorch extensions compilation (diff-gaussian-rasterization_fastgs).


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --branch fast-dropgaussian https://github.com/fastgs/FastGS.git
cd FastGS
```

### ⚙️ Environment Setup

We provide a streamlined setup using Conda:

```shell
# Windows only
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1

# Create and activate environment
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate fast-dropgaussian
```

 Alternatively, use **Pixi** (Recommended for this setup):

```bash
# Install environment
pixi install

# Run training
pixi run train -s <path_to_source> -m <path_to_output>
```

### 📊 Visualization

**Tensorboard** is enabled for monitoring loss and metrics:
```bash
pixi run tensorboard --logdir output
```

**Real-time Viewer**:
The training script starts a server on port `6009` (or specified via `--port`). You can connect a SIBR remote viewer to this port to see the Gaussian Splatting training in real-time.

### 🗂️ Data Preparation

First, download the LLFF Dataset from the [official website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/llff-dataset-full).

Next, download the DropGaussian-processed sparse and dense point clouds from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P3I9m_HU0jF50qwxIIhXhegOVk-kihdI), and place the data into the corresponding folders:

```

│       ├── 6_views/

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">📋 Advanced: Command Line Arguments for train.py</span></summary>

  #### --loss_thresh
  Threshold of the loss map; a lower value generally results in more Gaussians being retained.
  #### --grad_abs_thresh 
  Absolute gradient (same as Abs-GS) threshold for split.
  #### --grad_thresh
  Gradient(same as vanilla 3DGS) threshold for clone.
  #### --highfeature_lr
  Learning rate for high-order SH coefficients (features_rest).
  #### --lowfeature_lr
  Learning rate for low-order SH coefficients (features_dc).
  #### --dense
  Percentage of scene extent (0--1) a point must exceed to be forcibly densified.
  #### --mult 
  Multiplier for the compact box to control the tile number of each splat
  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path where the trained model should be stored (```output/<random>``` by default).
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.
  #### --resolution / -r
  Specifies resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. **If not set and input image width exceeds 1.6K pixels, inputs are automatically rescaled to this target.**
  #### --data_device
  Specifies where to put the source image data, ```cuda``` by default, recommended to use ```cpu``` if training on large/high-resolution dataset, will reduce VRAM consumption, but slightly slow down training. Thanks to [HrsPythonix](https://github.com/HrsPythonix).
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --sh_degree
  Order of spherical harmonics to be used (no larger than 3). ```3``` by default.
  #### --convert_SHs_python
  Flag to make pipeline compute forward and backward of SHs with PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --convert_cov3D_python
  Flag to make pipeline compute forward and backward of the 3D covariance with PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --debug
  Enables debug mode if you experience erros. If the rasterizer fails, a ```dump``` file is created that you may forward to us in an issue so we can take a look.
  #### --debug_from
  Debugging is **slow**. You may specify an iteration (starting from 0) after which the above debugging becomes active.
  #### --iterations
  Number of total iterations to train for, ```30_000``` by default.
  #### --ip
  IP to start GUI server on, ```127.0.0.1``` by default.

  Space-separated iterations at which to store a checkpoint for continuing later, saved in the model directory.
  #### --start_checkpoint
  Path to a saved checkpoint to continue training from.
  #### --quiet
